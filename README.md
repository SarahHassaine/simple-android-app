# simple-android-app
Just a simple android app that fetches and displays a list of things
The app uses retrofit and RxJava for api calls. Uses Hilt for dependency injection. Uses Compose.

Suggested improvements:
- Loading spinner/state whilst fetching albums to show the user the application is loading
- Allow user to search the list of albums
- Tapping on album brings up a photo gallery for that album
